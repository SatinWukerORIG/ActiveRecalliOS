# Active Recall - Product Overview

## Core Value Proposition
Effortless learning through interruption. The app utilizes "dead time" (unlocking phone, waiting for apps to load, and when it gets to a certain time) to reinforce memory pathways without requiring dedicated study sessions.

## Key Features
- **Content Management**: The recalling content can be: 1. Simple front/back text cards with subject organization. 2. A piece of information such as a formula, vocabulary, or phrase.
- **Content Creation**: Users can feed study materials to an LLM, and the LLM generates the recalling content (which can either be flashcards or pieces of information).
- **Smart Interruptions**: Unlock triggers, app-specific overlays, and time-based notifications
- **Spaced Repetition**: SM-2 algorithm implementation for optimal learning intervals
- **Context Awareness**: Focus mode, sleep schedule, and emergency bypass options

## Target Users
Students, professionals, and lifelong learners who want to maximize learning during micro-moments throughout their day.

## Platform Strategy
- **Android**: Full interruption capabilities with overlay permissions
- **iOS**: Rich notifications, widgets, and Screen Time API integration due to platform limitations

## Growth Strategy
Community deck sharing for viral adoption, with import support for existing Anki/Quizlet content.
